# Skill: Ontology Management

## USE FOR

- Adding, modifying, or removing Work-Product types, statuses, or link types
- Understanding the ontology.toml schema structure
- Classifying ontology changes (additive vs. breaking)
- Understanding governance rules for ontology changes

## Schema: .syspilot/ontology.toml

The canonical ontology lives at `.syspilot/ontology.toml`. Sphinx-needs reads
it directly via `needs_from_toml` in `docs/conf.py`.

### Section Separator Convention

The file has two kinds of top-level sections:

1. **`[needs]` sections** — understood by sphinx-needs / ubCode.
   Sphinx-needs reads only `[needs]` and ignores sibling keys.
2. **Non-`[needs]` sections** (e.g. `[syspilot]`) — syspilot-specific metadata,
   ignored by sphinx-needs.

### ubCode Sections (under `[needs]`)

```toml
[needs]
id_required = true
build_json = true
build_json_per_id = true
flow_engine = "graphviz"
extra_options = ["priority", "rationale", "acceptance_criteria"]

[[needs.types]]
directive = "story"
title = "User Story"
prefix = "US_"
color = "#E8D5B7"
style = "node"

# ... more types ...

[[needs.statuses]]
name = "draft"
description = "Draft - Work in progress"

# ... more statuses ...

[[needs.extra_links]]
option = "defines"
incoming = "is defined by"
outgoing = "defines"
```

### syspilot Sections

```toml
[syspilot]
schema_version = "1.0"
```

#### `[syspilot.actors]`

Flat mapping of Need type directive to its primary owning actor. Each agent
reads its own name to discover which types it owns.

```toml
[syspilot.actors]
story     = "System Designer"
req       = "System Designer"
spec      = "System Designer"
def       = "System Designer"
impl      = "Dev Engineer"
test      = "Test Designer"
uat       = "Test Designer"
unit_test = "Dev Engineer"
```

#### `[[syspilot.type_links]]`

Array of directed, bottom-up relationships between Need types. Each entry
has `from`, `to`, and `rel` fields.

```toml
[[syspilot.type_links]]
from = "req"
to   = "story"
rel  = "provides"

[[syspilot.type_links]]
from = "spec"
to   = "req"
rel  = "implements"

# ... more entries ...
```

#### `[syspilot.status_transitions]`

Lifecycle state machine. `universal` transitions apply to all types unless
overridden. `universal_exit` lists statuses reachable from any state.
Per-type overrides replace the universal set for that type.

```toml
[syspilot.status_transitions]
universal = [
  { from = "draft",       to = "approved" },
  { from = "draft",       to = "open" },
  { from = "open",        to = "approved" },
  { from = "approved",    to = "implemented" },
  { from = "implemented", to = "verified" },
]
universal_exit = ["deprecated"]

[syspilot.status_transitions.overrides.story]
transitions = [
  { from = "draft",    to = "approved" },
  { from = "approved", to = "verified" },
]
```

## How to Edit

### Adding a New Type

1. Add a `[[needs.types]]` entry to `.syspilot/ontology.toml`:
   ```toml
   [[needs.types]]
   directive = "mytype"
   title = "My Type"
   prefix = "MT_"
   color = "#AABBCC"
   style = "node"
   ```
2. Verify with `sphinx-build -W`.

### Adding a New Status

Add a `[[needs.statuses]]` entry:
```toml
[[needs.statuses]]
name = "my_status"
description = "My Status - description"
```

### Adding a New Link Type

Add a `[[needs.extra_links]]` entry:
```toml
[[needs.extra_links]]
option = "mylink"
incoming = "is linked by"
outgoing = "links to"
```

## Governance Guardrails

`ontology.toml` is a **guarded artifact**. Every change must be classified.

### Change Classification

| Change | Classification | Gate |
|--------|---------------|------|
| Add a new type | Additive | Normal CR |
| Add a new status | Additive | Normal CR |
| Add a new link type | Additive | Normal CR |
| Add a new extra_option | Additive | Normal CR |
| Add/modify `[syspilot]` metadata | Additive | Normal CR |
| Remove or rename a type | **Breaking** | Migration CR required |
| Remove or rename a status | **Breaking** | Migration CR required |
| Remove or rename a link type | **Breaking** | Migration CR required |
| Change a type's directive or prefix | **Breaking** | Migration CR required |

### Breaking Change Process

A breaking change triggers a **migration CR** that must:

1. Update all existing specs referencing the affected type/status/link.
2. Verify `sphinx-build -W` passes after migration.
3. Be merged before or atomically with the ontology change.

### Safety Net

1. **`sphinx-build -W`** (every CR) — catches type/link mismatches immediately.
2. **Governance classification** (process) — catches intent before implementation.
