# syspilot.pm — Tailoring for the syspilot project

## Deviation Detection

If you detect a contradiction between the pm.agent.md standard workflow, this
tailoring document, and observed current practice — stop and clarify with the
user before proceeding. Do not silently adopt the current practice as the new
norm.

## Backlog

GitHub Issues (enthali/syspilot) is the single source of truth for the backlog.
No separate backlog file.

## One CR at a Time

Send one CR to CM, wait for merge confirmation, then send the next.
CM is a change executor — planning and sequencing stay in the PM session.

## QM Sign-off

Wait for a **direct message from Quality Manager** before merging.
Do not accept CM-relayed QM clearance — only a direct QM inbox message counts.

## Post-Release Distribution

After the Release Agent completes its work (version bump, changelog, tag), PM
triggers the **syspilot Setup Agent** to install the latest release into this
repository. Releases are active pull operations — there is no automatic CD push.

## Change Document Location

Change documents are placed in `docs/changes/<version>/` where `<version>` is
the target release version. The directory must exist before committing the
change document. Create it if needed.

## GitHub Issue Lifecycle (Board + Reminder Pattern)

This project tracks work on **GitHub Project "Syspilot" #5** (board fields: Status, Priority).
GitHub Issues are PM-owned end-to-end — no other agent opens, edits, or closes them.

**After PM merges a feature branch into `development` (Step 13):**
- Set the board Status of every tracked issue (`gh project item-edit … --single-select-option-id`) to **"Merged"**.
  Field ID: `PVTSSF_lAHOAFDYiM4Bdr-CzhYLwvE` (Status); option ID for Merged: add this field via the board UI first, then record the option ID here.
- Leave the GitHub Issue **open** — it is not done until released.

**After SEND to Release Agent (Step 15):**
- Set a `jarvis_setReminder` for yourself: `"Check CI on main for release; if green, close issues #X #Y ... with release notes link."`, deliverAt: ~30 min after expected release completion.

**At reminder delivery:**
- Run `gh run list --repo enthali/syspilot --branch main --limit 5` and verify the latest workflow run concluded successfully.
- If green: set each tracked issue's board Status to **Done** directly (`singleSelectOptionId: 98236657`). The "Status updated to Done" automation closes the issue automatically. **Do not close first and rely on the reverse automation** — if the issue is at "Merged" status, the "Item closed → Done" automation may not fire (GitHub automation does not reliably override a custom pre-existing status). Setting Done first is the reliable direction.
- If red: do not close. Escalate to the user.

**Board automation (bidirectional — verified 2026-07-22):**
- "When an item is closed" → sets Status: Done (unreliable if current status is not a default state)
- "When Status is updated to Done" → closes the issue (reliable in all states)
→ **Preferred post-release action: set Status → Done. Auto-close follows.**

**Board field IDs for reference (do not re-query unless project is rebuilt):**
- Project node ID: `PVT_kwHOAFDYiM4Bdr-C`
- Status field ID: `PVTSSF_lAHOAFDYiM4Bdr-CzhYLwvE`
- Priority field ID: `PVTSSF_lAHOAFDYiM4Bdr-CzhYLwvw`
- Priority options: P0=`79628723`, P1=`0a877460`, P2=`da944a9c`
- Status options: Backlog=`f75ad846`, Ready=`61e4505c`, In progress=`47fc9ee4`, In review=`df73e18b`, Merged=`d5c9819d`, Done=`98236657`
- **WIP limit on "In progress": 1 CR** — if a second *CR* needs to go "In progress", something is wrong; resolve the active CR first. Epics are exempt from this limit: an Epic may coexist on "In progress" alongside 1 active CR, because an Epic is a container ticket, not a work item. The signal to watch is: two *CRs* both showing "In progress" → stop and resolve.
- **Epic status convention:** Epics sit on "In progress" while any of their sub-issues are active, and move to "Done" (auto, via close) when all sub-issues are closed. Epics never go to "Ready", "In review", or "Merged".
- **Ready definition:** A non-Epic issue is "Ready" when all design decisions are resolved and PM could write the CR Summary immediately without further clarification. PM populates the issue body with the intended scope before setting Ready. This is the pull queue: when "In progress" becomes free, PM picks the next "Ready" item.

## Infrastructure Changes

Tooling, CI, Sphinx config, and release pipeline changes are **not spec-driven**.
- PM creates a feature branch + lightweight change document (L0-L2 sections marked "N/A — infrastructure change")
- PM implements directly (does not send to CM)
- QM review is still performed
- PM merges to `development` after QM sign-off

## `experimental` Branch Purpose (updated 2026-08-01)

`experimental` is no longer the infra-change staging branch (that role folded
into `development` above, see "Infrastructure Changes"). It now hosts the
"syspilot v2" exploration — a from-scratch rethink of the architecture,
parked in the PM actor's `idea-syspilot-v2-greenfield.md` memory file. It was
force-synced to `development`'s tip on 2026-08-01 as the starting point.

v1 (`development`/`main`) is NOT frozen — this is exploration, not a decided
fork. No freeze/maintenance-mode rule applies yet. If v2 is ever adopted as
the project's future direction (e.g. targeting a `0.11.0`), define the v1
freeze rule at that point, not before.

## Feature Branch Retention (override)

Overrides the `syspilot.branching` skill's default retention policy for this
project: **delete feature branches on `origin` after they are squash-merged
into `development` and the containing release has shipped.** Local branches
may still be kept for a while but are not load-bearing — `development`/`main`
history is authoritative. Applied retroactively 2026-08-01 as a one-time
cleanup of stale remote branches accumulated before this override existed.
