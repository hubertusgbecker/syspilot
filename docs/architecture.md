# Architecture: Product & Installation

## Overview

syspilot separates **what it delivers** from **how each project uses it**.
The Product is the distribution package; each project installs a copy and
customizes it via the agent architecture (Soul, Duties, Workflow). Agent
frontmatter no longer prescribes a `tools:` list — the VS Code tool picker
proved unstable across saves and window reloads, silently rewriting or
dropping enumerated lists independent of any syspilot action. Agents instead
inherit whatever tools are enabled on your default VS Code agent. Setup is the
exception: it declares execution capability because it launches the installed
deterministic runtime directly.

| Layer | What it is | Where it lives |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Product** | The generic agent toolkit — agents, skills, scripts, templates | `syspilot/` |
| **Installed Copy** | Native files for the selected production harness plus shared runtime resources | `.github/` or `.opencode/`, with `.syspilot/` |

The deterministic Installer copies Product files into a project. Installed
Setup launches that runtime for updates. Specifications live in
`docs/syspilot/` and cover all agents at the product level.

**Harness installs.** The current support matrix is:

| Harness | Status | Evidence boundary |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| GitHub Copilot in VS Code | Production | Native project agents and prompts remain byte-exact to product source. |
| OpenCode | Production | Native configuration parsing and live Manager-to-Engineer Task delegation are accepted. |
| Claude Code | Experimental | Native discovery and adapter validation pass, but authenticated invocation and delegation are unexecuted. |
| Qoder | Experimental | Deterministic adapter fixtures exist; live native acceptance is unexecuted. |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | Evaluated, not production-certified | Artifact compatibility was checked, but no GitHub.com Copilot credential was available for live invocation. |

GitHub Copilot production support refers to the VS Code integration, not the
GitHub Copilot CLI. Agent/Skill content (Soul, Duties, Workflow, Instructions,
Rules) is a single source of truth — never
forked per harness. Only the frontmatter block and target directory are
adapted per harness. Each install command selects exactly one production
harness and writes no other harness directory. See `SYSP_SPEC_HARNESS_TARGET_MATRIX` and
`docs/syspilot/design/spec_harness_adapters.rst` for the full mapping and
limitations.

**Transaction boundary.** Before mutation, the Installer resolves one source
revision, parses and adapts all content, freezes the complete target plan, and
validates every destination. A bounded checkpoint contains only declared
mutable paths and required Git metadata. An opaque, expiring identifier carries
the checkpoint from Setup's preparation process to the installation process;
HMAC authentication and an atomic one-time lease reject tamper, concurrent use,
and replay before mutation. Secrets and lease state remain in protected OS
temporary storage outside the target. Each mutation and restore rejects
symlinks, junctions, and reparse points in target ancestry. POSIX mutations
stay relative to opened no-follow directory descriptors, while Windows retains
handle identity and reparse-point checks. Rollback restores only
transaction-owned paths, preserving unrelated files and concurrent changes
outside the plan.


## Why the Separation?

Three problems drove this design:

1. **Reusability** — The same agents work across many projects. A change management
   agent doesn't need to know your CI/CD setup. By keeping agents generic in the
   Product, they can be installed in any project without modification.

2. **Update safety** — When syspilot releases a new version, methodology agents
   (design, uat, mece, trace, docu) are replaced automatically. Project-owned
   agents (release, implement) are never overwritten.

3. **Clear ownership** — Every file has an explicit owner (methodology or project).
   This eliminates guesswork about what's safe to edit and what will
   be overwritten on the next update.


## What is Product?

The **Product** is everything in the `syspilot/` directory at the repository root.
It's the distribution package — what gets installed into target projects.

```

└── templates/
    └── change-document.md         # Change Document template
```

**Key properties:**

- **Language-agnostic** — No project-specific code, build commands, or test runners
- **Self-contained** — Everything needed for installation in one directory
- **Versioned** — The `version:` field in `syspilot/agents/syspilot.setup.agent.md` frontmatter tracks the release; main branch = current release
- **Single source of truth** — The Installer sources all distributable files
  exclusively from `syspilot/`, never from `.github/` or project config
- **Deterministic orchestration** — Installation always selects
  `syspilot.orchestration-subagent`; it does not inspect Jarvis state or offer
  an orchestration choice.


## How Installation Works

```{mermaid}

    P["<b>Product</b> (syspilot/)<br/>Generic agents, skills, templates"]
    G["<b>Selected harness + .syspilot/</b><br/>Native files and shared runtime resources"]
    S["<b>docs/syspilot/</b><br/>Product-level specifications<br/>(US → REQ → SPEC)"]

    R["<b>Installer runtime</b><br/>Remote first run, local updates"]
    P -- "Selected revision" --> R
    R -- "Installs selected<br/>harness files" --> G
    S -- "Specifications describe<br/>agent architecture" --> G
```

The flow:

1. **Initial install** runs the remote PEP 723 Installer from the target Git repository root
2. **Installer runtime** resolves one source revision and writes only the explicitly selected harness target
3. **Installed Setup** runs `.syspilot/installer.py` directly for updates
4. **Specifications** in `docs/syspilot/` document the agent architecture
   with full traceability (US → REQ → SPEC)
5. **sphinx-needs** resolves `:links:` across the spec hierarchy, enabling impact analysis


## Concrete Example: The PM Agent

The Project Manager agent demonstrates the Product/Installation pattern with the
tailoring file mechanism:

**Product** (`syspilot/agents/syspilot.pm.agent.md`):
- Generic workflow skeleton — 17 steps, zero project-specific nouns
- Branch naming, change-doc location, and post-release distribution are
  deliberately absent; they live in the tailoring file
- Preflight block directs the agent to read its tailoring file before executing

**Specifications** (`docs/syspilot/design/spec_project_mgr.rst`):
- `SYSP_SPEC_PM_WORKFLOW` specifies the Preflight pattern and Tailoring Workflow
- `SYSP_SPEC_AGENT_ARCH_WORKFLOW` defines the generic Tailoring File property
  and provides the canonical preflight sentence template

**Tailoring file** (`.github/agents/syspilot.pm.tailoring.md` — created on first PM invocation):
- Instance-only; never shipped by setup, never overwritten on update
- Captures this project's bindings: branch base, change-doc path, backlog
  location, merge target, post-release mechanism
- May be empty (proceed generic), clarify a step, or override it
- Authored by PM via the Tailoring Workflow on first invocation; the file
  does not exist until PM runs for the first time in a new project


## Skill Tailoring

Skills support the same per-project override mechanism as Agents, with one
simplification: every Skill convention ships with a safe default, so there is
no RESPOND-escalation step — a project that never tailors a skill simply gets
the documented default behavior.

**Product** (`syspilot/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`):
- Defines conventions with explicit, safe defaults (e.g. the `syspilot.branching`
  skill's feature-branch retention policy defaults to retain)

**Specification** (`SYSP_SPEC_SKILL_ARCH_TAILORING`):
- Defines the generic tailoring-file contract for Skills: an optional
  `tailoring.md` file colocated with `SKILL.md`, read by any agent invoking
  that skill

**Tailoring file** (`syspilot.<skill-name>.tailoring.md` — instance-only, optional):
- May be absent entirely — the skill's documented default applies
- Never shipped by setup, never overwritten on update
- Example: a project may tailor `syspilot.branching` to delete feature
  branches after merge instead of retaining them


## Update Safety

syspilot separates **Agents** (stable processes — WHAT to do) from **Skills**
(exchangeable tool bindings — HOW to do it). Agents define workflow steps;
skills encapsulate domain knowledge that agents invoke. Customize syspilot
by swapping skills, not agents.

syspilot defines three ownership categories that determine what happens on update:

| Category | What | On Update |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Installed product** | syspilot agents, prompts, skills, templates, runtime | **Synchronized** — replaced from the selected source revision |
| **Tailoring** | `syspilot.*.tailoring.md` files | **Preserved** — never removed as orphans |
| **User-owned** | Your specs, change docs, project configuration | **Preserved** — outside installation scope |

**Orphan cleanup** — The Installer removes stale files from previous syspilot versions,
but only files whose name **starts with `syspilot.`** and does **not** end with
`.tailoring.md`. Any file without a `syspilot.` prefix and all `*.tailoring.md` files
are always preserved, regardless of whether they appear in the current release.

**How to customize safely:**

1. **Use tailoring files for project-specific steps** — Each agent reads a sibling
   `syspilot.<name>.tailoring.md` file for project-specific details (paths, branch
   names, distribution targets). Edit this file freely — it is instance-only and
   never removed or overwritten by updates. If it is missing, the agent will walk
   you through creating it.

2. **Don't edit methodology agents directly** — Your changes will be overwritten on
   the next update. Instead, file a change request upstream.

3. **Customize project-owned agents via `@syspilot.design`** — This creates proper
   specs with traceability. The next update won't touch these files.

4. **Transactional rollback** — Before writing any files, the Installer creates
  a complete authenticated checkpoint outside the repository and consumes its
  opaque identifier exactly once. On failure it restores exact file bytes,
  directory state, and the Git index. No partial install or checkpoint secret
  persists.

## Ontology Architecture *(Phase 0: spec · Phase 1: flat-master)*

syspilot separates four concerns cleanly so that the default L0/L1/L2 hierarchy
can be replaced by any project ontology (e.g. ASPICE) without rewriting agents.

| Concern | What it defines |
|---------|----------------|
| **Ontology** | Work-Product types, typed relations, lifecycle states, ownership |
| **Capabilities** | Type-agnostic operations (create, modify, check, validate) |
| **Actors** | Which Capabilities and Work-Product types each Actor owns |
| **Process** | Execution order derived from the ontology graph; gate conditions |

### Key Invariants

- **`syspilot.toml` is the single authority** for ontology selection and tailoring.
  `conf.py` is an adapter/consumer of `syspilot.toml`, never an independent authority.
- Every active Work-Product type has exactly **one Primary-Actor-Owner**
  (1:N ownership is forbidden; read access is unrestricted).
- An Actor processes *all and only* its own affected types in the **dependency order
  of the ontology graph** — not a fixed L0/L1/L2 loop.
- Branching graphs are first-class. "Dependency order" means graph order.

### `.syspilot/` Directory Structure

The per-project `.syspilot/` directory holds all ontology and capability files:

```
.syspilot/
├── ontology.toml           # Canonical ontology master; sphinx-needs reads [needs] directly
├── ontologies/
│   └── <name>/
│       └── ontology.toml  # Ontology template definition
└── capabilities/
    └── <name>.toml        # Capability declarations (optional overrides)
```

The **syspilot-default** ontology (`us → req → spec`, L0/L1/L2) ships as a
built-in template. Other ontology templates are first-class; selecting one
does not require agent changes.

*Spec elements:* `SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_FOUR_CONCERNS`, `SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_TOML_SCHEMA`,
`SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_DIRECTORY`, `SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_GRAPH`, `SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_CAPABILITIES`.

### Phase 1: Flat-Master Architecture

**Delivered:** `.syspilot/ontology.toml` is the single canonical ontology file.
There is no intermediate projection or generated file. `docs/conf.py` points
sphinx-needs directly at it via:

```python
needs_from_toml = "../.syspilot/ontology.toml"
```

sphinx-needs consumes the `[needs]` section; `[syspilot.*]` sections are
ignored by the build tool (reserved for syspilot agents, Phase 2+).

**Safety net:** `sphinx-build -W` validates the master directly — a malformed
or stale ontology breaks the build immediately.

**Skill:** `syspilot.ontology` encapsulates ontology governance operations
(schema documentation, validation guardrails).
