# syspilot Release Notes

## v0.5.5 - 2026-05-13

### Summary
Patch release fixing the CI version-validation workflow. The GitHub Actions `release.yml` was still reading from the removed `version.json` file; it now reads the `version:` field directly from the Setup Agent frontmatter, restoring CI validation for all future release tags. Also includes a process improvement establishing the 3-class Artefakt-Removal Rule in the CM Workflow and Change Document Template.

### 🔧 Fixes & Improvements

- **CI Version Source Fix** (`ci-version-source-fix`)
  - GitHub Actions `release.yml` updated to read version from `syspilot/agents/syspilot.setup.agent.md` frontmatter instead of the removed `syspilot/version.json`
  - CI now correctly validates that a pushed release tag matches the Setup Agent `version:` field
  - All remaining `version.json` references removed from CI workflows and scripts
  - All documentation references to `version.json` removed from `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/methodology.md`, and `docs/workflows.md`

## v0.5.4 - 2026-05-13

### Summary
Minor release completing the Duties/Workflow conformance sweep across all agents, establishing Skill Architecture as a first-class architectural component, and introducing Bootloader Schema v2 (`files[]` array + Soul/Guardrail alignment). Includes housekeeping cleanup of deferred skill-architecture findings and PM Duties completeness extensions.

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Skill Architecture Foundation** (`skill-architecture-foundation`)
  - Skill Architecture anchored alongside Agent Architecture in the spec hierarchy
  - New `SYSP_US_SKILL_ARCH` User Story and `SYSP_REQ_SKILL_DEFINITIONS` Requirement created
  - `docs/syspilot/conventions.md` documents Agent and Skill conventions including DEFINITIONS Dictionary pattern and Mutual Exclusion per group

- **Agent Architecture: Duties/Workflow Definition** (`agent-arch-duties-workflow-definition`)
  - `SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_DUTIES` and `SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_WORKFLOW` now establish a clear conceptual separation: Duties = outcome guarantees (WHAT), Workflow = ordered execution steps (HOW)
  - Removes structural ambiguity that forced content duplication across both sections
  - Outside-loop Analyst repair; behavioural enforcement remains an open item

### 🔧 Fixes & Improvements

- **Bootloader Schema v2** (`bootloader-schema-v2`)
  - `bootstrap.json` uses a `files[]` array with `source`/`destination` per entry; `entry_point` field removed — manifest is now extensible without Bootloader changes
  - Bootloader Soul and Guardrail corrected: accurately reflects that it installs exactly the files in `bootstrap.json`, resolving the Soul/Guardrail contradiction
  - New Duty: **Manifest Fidelity** — after every run, exactly the declared files have been placed
  - All affected specs (US, REQ, SPEC for setup/bootloader) updated

- **PM Duties Completeness** (`pm-duties-completeness`)
  - PM Duties extended with Release-Trigger (PM decides when to release + invokes Release Agent) and Setup-Trigger (PM triggers instance update via Setup Agent after release)
  - `SYSP_US_DESIGN` AC1 clarified: Designer reads the Change Document created by CM — not creates it

- **Duties Conformance — Implement, MECE, PM** (`agent-files-conformance-implement-mece-pm`)
  - Top-to-bottom Duties conformance refactor for Dev Engineer, MECE Engine, and Project Manager
  - Outcome-based Duties (4 / 4 / 6 respectively); numbered lists replaced with outcome bullets; ACs as end-state guarantees

- **Duties Conformance — CM, UAT, Design** (`agent-files-conformance-cm-uat-design`)
  - Duties conformance refactor for Change Manager, UAT Engineer, and Design Engineer
  - Outcome guarantees; bullets instead of numbered lists; REQ ACs as end-state guarantees

- **Duties Conformance — Release** (`agent-files-conformance-release`)
  - Release Engineer Duties rewritten as outcome guarantees; numbered lists replaced with bullets; REQ ACs as end-state guarantees

- **Duties Conformance — Verify, QM** (`agent-files-conformance-verify-qm`)
  - Duties conformance refactor for Verify Engineer and Quality Manager
  - Each Duty has at least one corresponding AC (CE-gap pattern fix)

### 🏠 Housekeeping

- **Cleanup: Skill Architecture Followups** (`cleanup-skill-arch-followups`)
  - RST-lint: replaced single-backtick inline roles/literals with double backticks in `docs/syspilot/**` to eliminate `inline.role_no_name` diagnostics
  - `SYSP_US_SETUP` extended with Mutual Exclusion AC

### 📋 Change Requests

## v0.5.3 - 2026-05-02

### Summary
Patch release with three process and tooling fixes: QM now dispatches separate MECE checks per specification level, the Release Agent uses deterministic file scanning for archival and release notes generation, and version tracking is consolidated in the Setup Agent frontmatter (removing the redundant `version.json`). Includes model assignment sync (Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5).

### 🔧 Fixes & Improvements

- **Bootloader + Installer Split** (`bootloader-installer-split`)
  - Split Setup Agent into Bootloader + Installer: Bootloader always fetches current Installer from upstream, breaking the self-hosting bootstrap cycle
  - `syspilot.setup.agent.md` is now the lightweight Bootloader; `syspilot.installer.agent.md` is the full installation engine (not user-invocable)
  - `syspilot/bootstrap.json` is a new server-side manifest; never stored on the customer system

- **QM MECE Per Level** (`qm-mece-per-level`)
  - QM dispatches separate MECE checks for each specification level (L0 User Stories, L1 Requirements, L2 Design Specs)
  - Each MECE invocation receives exactly one level as input — no combined cross-level runs
  - Findings Report clearly indicates per-level pass/fail results

- **Release Explicit Sources** (`release-explicit-sources`)
  - Archive step explicitly scans all `*.md` files in `docs/changes/` (excluding subdirectories) — no session-context dependency
  - Document step generates release notes from the archived `docs/changes/<version>/` folder as the authoritative source
  - Prevents incomplete archival and missing release notes entries due to context drift

- **Release Version Source** (`release-version-source`)
  - Release Agent bumps the `version:` field in `syspilot/agents/syspilot.setup.agent.md` (product source of truth)
  - Redundant `syspilot/version.json` deleted
  - Setup Agent propagates the version to the installed instance on next setup run

### 🏠 Housekeeping

- Agent model assignments synced from tested instance to product files:
  - Claude Opus 4.6: design, implement (complex engineering tasks)
  - Claude Sonnet 4.6: cm, pm, qm, setup, release, uat, docu (orchestration and documentation)
  - Claude Haiku 4.5: mece, trace, verify (fast quality checks)

### 📋 Change Requests

| Change Document | Scope |
|----------------|-------|
| `qm-mece-per-level` | QM per-level MECE dispatch |
| `release-explicit-sources` | Release Agent deterministic file scan |
| `release-version-source` | Version in Setup Agent frontmatter, remove version.json |

## v0.5.2 - 2026-05-01

### Summary
Patch release with internal process fixes: PM/CM role boundaries clarified, merge gate process formalized, QM reduced to pure auditor role, Setup Agent preserves instance-specific tools on update, and CM sends post-merge confirmation to PM.

### 🔧 Fixes & Improvements

- **PM/CM Role Boundary** (`pm-cm-role-boundary`)
  - PM writes CRs from user perspective only (intent + user-visible ACs, no implementation details)
  - CM always follows the complete change process independently
  - Design Agent gets `vscode/askQuestions` in frontmatter for user-guided mode

- **Merge Gate Process** (`qm-merge-gate`)
  - CM does not merge to development without PM approval
  - QM results are always routed to PM who decides: fix now / defer / accept as-is
  - Formal merge gate between QM review and development merge

- **QM Auditor Only** (`qm-auditor-only`)
  - QM always produces Findings Reports addressed to PM — never creates CRs directly
  - Simplified QM model: one output format (Findings Report → PM)
  - Aligns with the Merge Gate pattern

- **Setup Preserve Tools** (`setup-preserve-tools`)
  - Setup Agent preserves instance-specific `tools:` frontmatter field during updates
  - Fresh installs copy `tools:` from product as-is
  - New agents are always copied completely

- **CM Merge Confirmation** (`cm-merge-confirmation`)
  - After merging to development, CM sends confirmation to PM with commit hash and branch name
  - Existing pre-merge notification remains unchanged

- **Skill Installed Path** (`skill-installed-path`)
  - SKILL.md references installed path (`.github/skills/`) instead of product path

- **Skill Owns Scripts** (`skill-owns-scripts`)
  - Scripts moved into skill folder for self-contained skills

- **Skill Script Convention** (`skill-script-convention`)
  - `scripts/` subdirectory convention + `.github/` scope rule for skill scripts

- **Setup User Changes Check** (`setup-user-changes-check`)
  - Customization guard: Setup Agent checks for user changes before overwriting
  - Same-version check to avoid unnecessary updates

- **Setup Version in Agent** (`setup-version-in-agent`)
  - Version tracking moved into `syspilot.setup.agent.md` frontmatter (`version:` field)

### 📋 Change Requests

## v0.5.1 - 2026-04-27

### Summary
Three workflow improvements and housekeeping: Setup Manager added as a 4th manager role with prompt specification, Release workflow fixed for correct development-first prep and back-merge, Impact Analysis mandated as a required step in the CM and Design workflows.

### ✨ New Features

- **Setup Manager as 4th Manager** (CR15, `agent-prompts-perspective`)
  - Setup Manager (`@syspilot.setup`) formally added as a 4th user-invocable manager role alongside PM, CM, QM
  - Prompt specification added: only user-invocable agents (managers) SHALL have prompt files
  - Agent Frontmatter and Prompt Frontmatter established as qualified terms in the spec hierarchy
  - Engineer User Story perspective corrected from "As a syspilot user, I want to have a [Agent]..." to "...I want my agentic managers to have a [Agent] that..."

### 🔧 Fixes & Improvements

- **Release Workflow Fix** (CR16)
  - Prep steps (archive, version bump, release notes, sphinx validation) now run on `development` first — not on `main`
  - Back-merge (`development ← main`) added as explicit step after tagging to sync the squash commit
  - Conflict guidance: `-X theirs` strategy documented for squash-merge conflicts (development wins)

- **Mandatory Impact Analysis** (CR17)
  - Impact Analysis is now a required step (SHALL) in the CM workflow before dispatching to System Designer
  - Impact Analysis is now a required step (SHALL) in the System Designer workflow before analysis
  - Acceptance Criterion AC-5 language corrected from MUST to SHALL for consistency

### 🏠 Housekeeping

- `.gitignore` updated: installed product copies (agents, prompts, skills, scripts) are now gitignored in consumer workspaces
- `docs/changes/` structure flattened: archives live directly at `docs/changes/vX.Y.Z/` (no `archive/` subfolder)
- v0.5.0 release notes backfilled on `development` branch

### 📋 Change Requests

| CR | Change Document | Scope |
|----|----------------|-------|
| CR15 | `agent-prompts-perspective` | Setup Manager, Prompt Specification, Engineer US perspective |
| CR16 | (workflow fix) | Release workflow prep + back-merge + conflict guidance |
| CR17 | (workflow fix) | Mandatory Impact Analysis in CM and Design workflows |

## v0.4.0 - 2026-04-07

### Summary
Two workflow improvements that make the development loop tighter and safer: the Change Agent now runs `@syspilot.mece` as an automatic subagent after each level write for advisory validation, and the Setup Agent now creates a git baseline commit after a successful fresh install or adoption.

### ✨ New Features

- **MECE Agent as Subagent in Change Agent** (SYSPILOT_SPEC_CHG_LIVE_RST_PER_LEVEL)
  - After each level write `@syspilot.change` automatically invokes `@syspilot.mece` as a subagent
  - MECE results are shown as advisory findings — non-blocking, but surfaced before moving on
  - Requires the `agents:` frontmatter field in the agent file (SYSPILOT_SPEC_AGENT_FRAMEWORK)
  - Replaces manual per-level write process; RST files are written immediately after approval

- **Git Baseline Commit after Fresh Install / Adoption** (#11, SYSPILOT_SPEC_INST_INSTALL_COMMIT)
  - `@syspilot.setup` now stages and commits all placed files after successful sphinx-build validation
  - Commit message: `chore: install syspilot v{version}` (new project) or `chore: adopt syspilot v{version}` (existing project)
  - Confirmation-gated: user approves commit before it is created
  - Handles pre-existing uncommitted changes: offers to commit only syspilot files separately, or skip
  - Graceful skip if git is not initialized or identity is not configured (informational message)
  - Does not run in update mode (that is handled by the update branch workflow)

### 🔧 Fixes & Improvements

- `@syspilot.change` writes RST per level immediately after approval (`:status: draft`), enabling live link traversal via `get_need_links.py` during analysis
- Change Document is always a lean decision log from the start, not a verbose RST dump

### 📋 Specs

- New: `SYSPILOT_REQ_INST_INSTALL_COMMIT`, `SYSPILOT_SPEC_INST_INSTALL_COMMIT`
- Modified: `SYSPILOT_SPEC_INST_SETUP_AGENT` (Section 8: Git Baseline Commit)
- Modified: `SYSPILOT_US_INST_NEW_PROJECT`, `SYSPILOT_US_INST_ADOPT_EXISTING` (AC-6 added)
- Modified: `SYSPILOT_SPEC_CHG_LIVE_RST_PER_LEVEL` (MECE subagent step)
- Modified: `SYSPILOT_SPEC_AGENT_FRAMEWORK` (`agents:` frontmatter field documented)

## v0.3.1 - 2026-04-03

### Summary
Safety improvement to the update workflow: the Setup Agent now creates a dedicated `update/v{version}` branch before performing any updates, detects project-specific extensions that would be silently lost when replacing methodology-owned files, and creates a change document summarizing what was updated.

### ✨ New Features

- **Update Branch Workflow** (#16, SYSPILOT_SPEC_INST_UPDATE_BRANCH)
  - `@syspilot.setup` (update mode) now creates `update/v{version}` branch before any file changes
  - All update work is committed on the dedicated branch
  - A change document `docs/changes/update-v{version}.md` is created summarizing replaced/skipped files
  - User reviews the branch diff and merges when ready

- **Post-Update Extension Review** (#16, SYSPILOT_SPEC_INST_POST_UPDATE_REVIEW)
  - After replacing methodology-owned files, compares old vs new content using `git show HEAD:<path>`
  - If a file had project-specific additions that are missing in the new version, the user is alerted
  - Per-file options: accept new version / merge back manually / restore old version
  - Silent skip if no custom extensions are detected

### 🔧 Fixes & Improvements

- Resolves silent data loss when updating syspilot if methodology-owned files had been customized (e.g., extra verification steps in `syspilot.verify.agent.md`)

### 📋 Specs

- New: `SYSPILOT_REQ_INST_POST_UPDATE_REVIEW`, `SYSPILOT_REQ_INST_UPDATE_BRANCH`
- New: `SYSPILOT_SPEC_INST_POST_UPDATE_REVIEW`, `SYSPILOT_SPEC_INST_UPDATE_BRANCH`
- Modified: `SYSPILOT_SPEC_INST_UPDATE_PROCESS` (Steps 0a, 3/4a, 6/7 added)
- Modified: `SYSPILOT_US_INST_UPDATE` (AC-7 and AC-8 added)

## v0.3.0 - 2026-04-02

### Summary
Structural improvements: local install support, skill format migration to VS Code standard, new architecture and workflows documentation pages with Mermaid diagrams, and branching strategy documentation.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Skill Format Migration** (#12, SYSPILOT_SPEC_AGENT_SKILL_FORMAT)
  - Skills now use folder format: `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  - Old format `.github/skills/<name>.skill.md` is no longer recognized
  - Run `@syspilot.setup` to migrate existing installations
  - YAML frontmatter with `name`/`description` enables automatic skill discovery

### ✨ New Features

- **Local Install Support** (#9, SYSPILOT_REQ_INST_LOCAL_SOURCE)
  - Setup agent detects `syspilot/` directory and offers local vs GitHub install
  - Enables testing agent changes before pushing (dogfooding workflow)
  - File ownership rules apply equally to local install

- **Architecture Documentation** (#15, SYSPILOT_REQ_DOC_ARCHITECTURE)
  - New `docs/architecture.md` — explains Product/Instance separation concept
  - 7 chapters: Why, What (Product + Instance), How They Relate, Concrete Example, Update Safety

- **Workflows Documentation** (#15, SYSPILOT_REQ_DOC_WORKFLOWS)
  - New `docs/workflows.md` — central syspilot process description
  - Covers all 3 workflows: Change, Quality, Release
  - Agent decision guide, workflow diagrams, branching strategy

- **Mermaid Diagram Support**
  - Added `sphinxcontrib-mermaid` to Sphinx extensions
  - All ASCII diagrams replaced with Mermaid flowcharts across docs and specs
  - Client-side rendering via mermaid.js (no build-time dependency)

- **Branching Strategy** (SYSPILOT_SPEC_DOC_WORKFLOWS_STRUCTURE)
  - Documented chained feature branches model
  - Main = releases only, squash merge during `@syspilot.release`

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Housekeeping**
  - Removed version tracking from memory agent scope (SYSPILOT_SPEC_MEM_SCOPE)
  - Archived v0.2.2 change documents to `docs/changes/archive/v0.2.2/`

- **Traceability**
  - Added outgoing links from SPEC_DOC_WORKFLOWS_STRUCTURE to agent design specs
  - Impact analysis now catches documentation when agent specs change

### 📋 Issues Closed

- #9 — Setup Agent: Support local install from syspilot/ directory
- #12 — Migrate skills to VS Code standard format
- #15 — Documentation: Architecture page for Product/Instance concept


## v0.2.3 - 2026-03-30

### Summary
Agent Family Framework with product/instance architecture, plus setup agent update process with file ownership model. Specs are now organized around agent families with independent spec trees. Instance-level specs capture project-specific decisions for release and implement agents. The setup agent bootstraps itself first, then uses a 3-category ownership model (methodology/project/user) to decide which files to update.

### ✨ New Features

- **Agent Family Framework** (SYSPILOT_US_CORE_SPEC_AS_CODE, SYSPILOT_REQ_CORE_FAMILY_ARCH)
  - Product/Instance two-layer spec architecture
  - Product specs define WHAT (generic), instance specs define HOW (project-specific)
  - Family-based naming: `SYSPILOT_*` (product), `INST_SYSPILOT_*` (instance)
  - Framework-level docs separated from family-specific docs
  - `docs/syspilot/` = product specs, `docs/inst/syspilot/` = instance specs

- **Instance Spec Tree** (SYSPILOT_US_INST_AGNOSTIC, SYSPILOT_REQ_INST_CUSTOM_PRESERVE)
  - 14 new INST spec elements across all 3 levels (US → REQ → SPEC)
  - Release agent instance config: version file, tag format, archive policy, validation
  - Implement agent instance config: language, framework, testing conventions

- **Setup Agent Self-Update** (SYSPILOT_US_INST_UPDATE, SYSPILOT_REQ_INST_BOOTSTRAP_SELF)
  - Bootstrap Step 0: setup agent updates itself first before updating anything else
  - 3-category file ownership model: methodology (always replace), project (copy once), user (never touch)
  - Template banner on generic release/implement agents prompting customization

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Release Agent** (INST_SYSPILOT_SPEC_REL_AGENT_CONFIG)
  - Replaced 441-line v0.2.1 fossil with customized KISS template (~60 lines)
  - Fixed: agent still contained `git rm` (delete) instead of `git mv` (archive)
  - Added squash merge step per SYSPILOT_SPEC_REL_WORKFLOW

- **Stale Path References**
  - Fixed 12× `templates/` → `syspilot/` in spec_release.rst, spec_change.rst
  - Moved `change-document.md` to `syspilot/templates/`

### 📦 Migration

- 130 spec IDs renamed with `SYSPILOT_` prefix
- 6 directory moves: `docs/{userstories,requirements,design}` → `docs/syspilot/`
- ~510 cross-reference updates across all RST files
- `copilot-instructions.md` updated with instance-level architecture

---

## v0.2.2 - 2026-03-17

### Summary
Two agent fixes: The release agent is refactored from a ~425-line syspilot-specific playbook into a ~45-line KISS template with an embedded decisions table. The setup agent now detects existing sphinx-needs installations before offering to install.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Release Agent Template** (US_REL_AGENT_TEMPLATE, REQ_REL_PROCESS_DOC, SPEC_REL_AGENT)
  - Fixed: agent was syspilot-specific, hard-coded paths like `templates/version.json`
  - Fixed: agent deleted change documents instead of archiving (violated REQ_CHG_CHANGE_DOC AC-5)
  - Refactored from ~425 to ~45 lines — KISS template with embedded decisions table
  - First `@syspilot.release` invocation bootstraps decisions by asking user
  - Closes [#5](https://github.com/hubertusgbecker/syspilot/issues/5)

- **Setup Agent Dependency Detection** (US_INST_BOOTSTRAP, REQ_INST_AUTO_SETUP, SPEC_INST_SETUP_AGENT)
  - Fixed: setup agent installed sphinx-needs without checking if already available
  - Now detects existing sphinx-needs and offers A/B/C options
  - Skips installation step when sphinx-needs already available

## v0.2.1 - 2026-03-16

### Summary
Internal improvement to the Implement Agent workflow. Adds a systematic Acceptance Criteria completeness check between Code Implementation and Quality Gates, preventing implementation gaps from reaching the Verify Agent. Based on real-world findings from Issue #4.

### 🔧 Internal Changes

- **Implementation Completeness Check** (US_CHG_IMPLEMENT, REQ_CHG_IMPL_AGENT AC-7)
  - New Step 4 in Implement Agent: AC-by-AC verification before quality gates (SPEC_IMPL_COMPLETENESS_CHECK)
  - Updated Quality Gate Workflow with completeness check prerequisite (SPEC_IMPL_QUALITY_GATES)
  - Common gap detection: modified REQs with new ACs, multi-condition specs, cross-component integration
  - Applied to both active agent (`.github/agents/`) and distributable template (`templates/agents/`)

---

## v0.2.0 - 2026-03-16

### Summary
Major architecture update introducing template-first distribution, curl-based installation, and documentation-as-implementation-artifact. The `templates/` directory is now the single source for all distributed files, replacing the previous auto-detect + init-script approach with a simple curl/Invoke-WebRequest bootstrap. Documentation maintenance is integrated into the implement and setup agents via per-document chapter structure SPECs. Comprehensive MECE quality review across all three specification levels.

### ✨ New Features

- **Template-First Architecture** (US_INST_AGNOSTIC, US_INST_CROSS_PROJECT, REQ_INST_TEMPLATE_SOURCE)
  - `templates/` directory as single source for distribution (SPEC_INST_TEMPLATE_LAYOUT)
  - `.github/` is consumer installation, may diverge from templates
  - Language-agnostic skeleton implement agent with TODO placeholders (REQ_INST_IMPL_SKELETON)
  - Self-install validation during release (SPEC_INST_SELF_INSTALL)
  - 8 agents, 8 prompts, 1 skill, 1 script distributed via templates

- **Curl-Based Setup** (US_INST_BOOTSTRAP, REQ_INST_AUTO_SETUP, REQ_INST_NEW_PROJECT)
  - Single curl command downloads setup agent from GitHub main (SPEC_INST_CURL_BOOTSTRAP)
  - Setup agent fetches all files from `templates/` via GitHub API (SPEC_INST_SETUP_AGENT)
  - Intelligent AI-driven merge for updates (SPEC_INST_FILE_OWNERSHIP)
  - Version tracking via `.syspilot/version.json` (SPEC_INST_VERSION_MARKER)
  - Init scripts removed — no local syspilot repo needed

- **Documentation Scope** (US_DOC_MAINTAIN, REQ_DOC_SCOPE)
  - Documentation as implementation artifact, not a separate workflow step

- **Release Workflow Exit Point** (release-exit)
  - Release workflow now defines what happens after publish: new change or end (US_WF_RELEASE, REQ_WF_RELEASE_SEQUENCE)
  - Release workflow diagram updated with exit point (SPEC_REL_WORKFLOW)

### 🔧 Internal Changes

- Verify agent handoff changed from "Create Release" to "Update Memory"
- Memory agent gained handoffs to change and release agents
- Implement agent removed unused release handoff
- copilot-instructions.md updated with agent handoff chain diagram

## v0.1.0-rc.1 - 2026-02-06

### Summary
Major structural refactoring preparing syspilot for public review. All specification files reorganized from monolithic per-level files into themed domain files. All IDs renamed from sequential (`US_SYSPILOT_001`) to descriptive format (`US_CORE_SPEC_AS_CODE`). New methodology guide, naming conventions, project logo, and rewritten documentation landing page.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **All sphinx-needs IDs renamed** from sequential to descriptive format
  - User Stories: `US_SYSPILOT_*` → `US_CORE_*`, `US_CHG_*`, `US_TRACE_*`, `US_INST_*`, `US_DX_*`, `US_REL_*`
  - Requirements: `REQ_SYSPILOT_*` → `REQ_CORE_*`, `REQ_CHG_*`, `REQ_TRACE_*`, `REQ_INST_*`, `REQ_DX_*`, `REQ_REL_*`
  - Design Specs: `SPEC_SYSPILOT_*` / `SPEC_RELEASE_*` → `SPEC_AGENT_*`, `SPEC_DOC_*`, `SPEC_INST_*`, `SPEC_REL_*`
- **Monolithic spec files removed**: `us_syspilot.rst`, `req_syspilot.rst` replaced by themed files
- Projects referencing old IDs must update their links

### 🔧 Refactoring

- **User Stories** split into 6 themed files by problem domain:
  `us_core.rst`, `us_change_mgmt.rst`, `us_traceability.rst`, `us_installation.rst`, `us_developer_experience.rst`, `us_release.rst`
- **Requirements** split into 6 matching files (1:1 mapping with US themes):
  `req_core.rst`, `req_change_mgmt.rst`, `req_traceability.rst`, `req_installation.rst`, `req_developer_experience.rst`, `req_release.rst`
- **Design Specs** kept as solution-domain files (intentional asymmetry), IDs renamed
- All `:links:` directives updated across 35 files
- Agent files, workflow, and traceability indices updated for new IDs

### 📚 Documentation

- **New**: methodology.md — File organization guide (problem vs solution domain, scaling rules)
- **New**: namingconventions.md — Descriptive ID naming convention (`<TYPE>_<THEME>_<SLUG>`)
- **New**: Project logo (light & dark mode SVG)
- **Rewritten**: README.md — concise, centered logo, link to full docs
- **Rewritten**: docs/index.rst — engaging landing page with Getting Started, FAQ
- **Updated**: copilot-instructions.md — new ID examples, file organization section

### 📝 Migration Notes

Previous releases used sequential IDs (`US_SYSPILOT_001`, `REQ_SYSPILOT_007`). All historical release notes preserve the original IDs for accuracy. New development should use the descriptive ID format documented in namingconventions.md.
