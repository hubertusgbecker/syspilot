Overview
--------

User Stories describe **what users want to achieve** and **why**.

**Format:**

   **As a** [role],
   **I want to** [action],
   **so that** [benefit].

**A-SPICE Alignment:**

User Stories serve as input to SWE.1 (Software Requirements Analysis).
They capture stakeholder needs before deriving system requirements.

**Hierarchy:**

::

   User Story (US_*)     ← Stakeholder perspective (WHY)
        ↓ :links:
   Requirement (REQ_*)   ← System behavior (WHAT)
