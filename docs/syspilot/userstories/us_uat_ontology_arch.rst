Ontology Architecture UAT
=========================

User Acceptance Test Story for the ``ontology-architecture-decision`` change
request — verifying that the Phase 0 architecture documentation is complete,
internally consistent, and correctly linked before any implementation begins.


.. story:: UAT: Ontology-Agnostic Architecture (Phase 0 Spec Review)
   :id: SYSP_US_UAT_ONTOLOGY_ARCH
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: uat, ontology, architecture, phase-0

   **As a** syspilot Test Designer,
   **I want** self-contained test scenarios that let a human verify the
   Phase 0 architecture documentation expresses all five key invariants clearly
   and without contradiction, and that the new spec elements form a complete,
   clean traceability chain,
   **so that** the architecture decision is reviewable, auditable, and ready
   to anchor the subsequent implementation phases.

   **Context:**

   Phase 0 is pure architecture documentation — no code, no agent changes.
   All UAT scenarios in this chain are spec-review scenarios: a human opens
   the referenced file, reads the referenced section, and confirms the stated
   condition. No runtime environment is required.

   **Artifacts Under Test:**

   * ``docs/syspilot/design/spec_ontology_arch.rst`` — all six spec elements:
     ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_FOUR_CONCERNS``, ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_TOML_SCHEMA``,
     ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_CAPABILITIES``, ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_DIRECTORY``,
     ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_GRAPH``, ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE``
   * ``docs/syspilot/requirements/req_ontology_arch.rst`` — seven REQ elements
   * ``docs/syspilot/userstories/us_ontology_arch.rst`` — two US elements
   * sphinx-build -W output — traceability and build gate

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   1. Given the spec element ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_FOUR_CONCERNS``, When I read it, Then it names and defines all four concerns (Ontology, Capabilities, Actors, Process), states the Independence Constraint explicitly, and shows stable-identifier interfaces between the concerns.
   2. Given the spec element ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_TOML_SCHEMA``, When I inspect its authority statement, Then ``syspilot.toml`` is unambiguously designated as the project-level entry point and single source of truth — no other file is designated as a configuration authority for ontology selection in any spec element of this CR.
   3. Given the spec element ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_TOML_SCHEMA``, When I read the Validation Constraints section, Then the constraint "every type SHALL have exactly one ownership assignment (no zero, no duplicates)" is present and unambiguous.
   4. Given the spec element ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_GRAPH``, When I read the Dependency Order and Branching Support sections, Then processing order is defined as topological order of the DAG, branching is explicitly first-class, and no reference to L0/L1/L2 numbering appears as the ordering mechanism.
   5. Given the spec element ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_DIRECTORY``, When I read the Layout and Discovery Convention sections, Then the directory path ``.syspilot/`` is named, ``ontology.toml`` is the file inside it, and discovery is described as resolving ``.syspilot/ontology.toml`` relative to the project root (anchored by ``syspilot.toml``).
   6. Given the spec element ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE``, When I inspect it, Then it declares three Work-Product types (user_story, requirement, design_spec), defines the dependency-edge chain design_spec → requirement → user_story, and explicitly states that this template SHALL pass all schema validation constraints in ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_TOML_SCHEMA``.
   7. Given all new spec elements (L0, L1, L2), When I check traceability links and run ``sphinx-build -W``, Then every L2 spec links to at least one L1 req, every L1 req links to at least one L0 US, and the build completes with zero warnings.
   8. Given the spec element ``SYSP_SPEC_ONTOLOGY_CAPABILITIES``, When I inspect it, Then it declares a type-agnostic capability vocabulary with ``id`` and ``description`` per entry, states that capability declarations are independent of the ontology graph, and specifies that type-specific constraints belong in Actor bindings — not in the capability declaration itself.

   **Testability Note:**

   AC-1 through AC-6 are read-only spec-review checks — no runtime environment
   is needed. AC-7 requires running ``sphinx-build -W`` (command given in
   ``SYSP_REQ_UAT_ONTOLOGY_ARCH``).

   **Traceability:**

   Test data is defined in ``SYSP_REQ_UAT_ONTOLOGY_ARCH``; expected outcomes
   in ``SYSP_SPEC_UAT_ONTOLOGY_ARCH``.
