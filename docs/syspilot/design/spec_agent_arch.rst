Agent Architecture Design
=========================

Meta-level definitions of Soul, Duties, and Workflow concepts.


.. spec:: Soul Definition
   :id: SYSP_SPEC_AGENT_ARCH_SOUL
   :status: draft
   :tags: agent-v2, meta, architecture, soul
   :links: SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_SOUL

   **Definition:**

   The **Soul** is the immutable core identity of an agent. It defines:

   * **Character** — personality traits, disposition, attitude toward work
   * **Perspective** — how the agent views problems and what it prioritizes
   * **Guardrails** — what the agent will never do, hard boundaries
   * **Care** — what the agent cares about most deeply

   **Properties:**

   * Immutable across customizations — changing the Soul is a breaking change
   * Written in second person ("You are...")
   * Short (3–5 sentences maximum)
   * Defines identity, not responsibilities or execution steps (accountability belongs in Duties; execution steps belong in Workflow)

   **Example Pattern:**

   ::

      You are the **[Persona]** — [character description]. You [what you care about].
      You are [traits]. You never [guardrail].

   **File:** ``## Soul`` section in ``.agent.md``


.. spec:: Duties Definition
   :id: SYSP_SPEC_AGENT_ARCH_DUTIES
   :status: draft
   :tags: agent-v2, meta, architecture, duties
   :links: SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_DUTIES

   **Definition:**

   **Duties** answer the question *What is this agent accountable for?*
   They enumerate the agent's responsibilities and expected outcomes. They define:

   * **Accountability** — what the agent owns and is responsible for delivering
   * **Scope** — what falls within this agent's responsibility
   * **Boundaries** — what is explicitly NOT this agent's job

   **Properties:**

   * Every agent definition SHALL contain a Duties section
   * Customer-customizable — duties can be added, removed, or modified
   * Each duty is independently enableable/disableable
   * Adding or removing a duty does not affect the Soul
   * Written as short, unordered responsibility statements
   * **Mutual Exclusion** — A single behavioural item SHALL appear in exactly
     one of Duties or Workflow — never both. If an item describes an outcome
     or accountability, it belongs in Duties. If it describes a step in the
     execution sequence, it belongs in Workflow.

   **Customization Examples:**

   * Remove a duty: customer doesn't need safety checks
   * Add a duty: customer needs domain-specific validation
   * Modify a duty: customer uses different MECE criteria

   **File:** ``## Duties`` section in ``.agent.md``


.. spec:: Workflow Definition
   :id: SYSP_SPEC_AGENT_ARCH_WORKFLOW
   :status: draft
   :tags: agent-v2, meta, architecture, workflow
   :links: SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_WORKFLOW

   **Definition:**

   The **Workflow** answers the question *How does this agent execute its work?*
   It defines the ordered sequence of execution steps the agent follows. It defines:

   * **Steps** — numbered, sequential execution actions
   * **Inputs** — what the agent needs to start
   * **Outputs** — what the agent produces
   * **Decision points** — where the flow can branch

   **Properties:**

   * Every agent definition SHALL contain a Workflow section
   * Customer-customizable — steps can be reordered, added, or skipped
   * Written as numbered steps with clear inputs/outputs
   * Modifying the Workflow does not affect the Soul
   * **Mutual Exclusion** — A single behavioural item SHALL appear in exactly
     one of Workflow or Duties — never both. If an item describes a step in
     the execution sequence, it belongs in Workflow. If it describes an outcome
     or accountability, it belongs in Duties.

   **Customization Examples:**

   * Reorder steps: different build sequence
   * Add a step: additional approval gate
   * Skip a step: no test generation needed

   **File:** ``## Workflow`` section in ``.agent.md``


.. spec:: Frontmatter Field Schema
   :id: SYSP_SPEC_AGENT_ARCH_FRONTMATTER
   :status: approved
   :tags: agent-v2, meta, architecture, frontmatter
   :links: SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_FRONTMATTER

   **Definition:**

   The **Agent Frontmatter** is a YAML block at the top of each ``.agent.md`` file,
   delimited by ``---``. It defines the following fields:

   * **description** (string, required) — One-sentence summary of the agent's
     purpose. Used by VS Code Copilot for agent discovery and selection.
   * **tools** (list of strings, required) — Permitted tool categories the agent
     can use (e.g., ``read``, ``edit``, ``search``, ``agent``, ``execute``).
   * **user-invocable** (boolean, required) — Whether users can invoke the agent
     directly via ``@syspilot.<name>``. Managers are ``true``; most engineers
     are ``false`` (invoked only as subagents).
   * **agents** (list of strings, required) — Subagents this agent can invoke
     via ``runSubagent()``. Empty list ``[]`` if the agent has no subagents.
   * **handover** (string, optional) — Target agent for handover delegation.
     Currently unused by all agents.
   * **version** (string, optional, default: absent) — The installed syspilot
     version string (e.g. ``0.5.1``). Only ``syspilot.setup.agent.md`` uses
     this field; all other agents omit it.

   **Example:**

   ::

      ---
      description: "Agent purpose summary."
      tools: [read, edit, search, execute]
      user-invocable: false
      agents: []
      ---

   **Constraint:** When ``agents:`` contains one or more entries, the ``agent``
   tool MUST be included in ``tools:``.


.. spec:: Prompt File Definition
   :id: SYSP_SPEC_AGENT_ARCH_PROMPT
   :status: draft
   :tags: agent-v2, meta, architecture, prompt
   :links: SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_PROMPT, SYSP_REQ_PM_PROMPT, SYSP_REQ_CM_PROMPT, SYSP_REQ_QM_PROMPT, SYSP_REQ_SETUP_PROMPT

   **Definition:**

   A **Prompt file** is the user-facing entry point for invoking an agent directly
   via VS Code Copilot's chat panel.

   **File format:**

   * File name: ``syspilot.<name>.prompt.md``
   * Location: ``syspilot/prompts/`` (product) or ``.github/prompts/`` (instance)
   * Minimal **Prompt Frontmatter**: ``agent: syspilot.<name>``

   **Scope:**

   * Only user-invocable agents (managers) have prompt files
   * Engineers are invoked via ``runSubagent()`` and do NOT need prompt files
   * The prompt file references the agent it belongs to via the ``agent`` field

   **Example:**

   ::

      ---
      agent: "syspilot.pm"
      ---
      [Prompt content for the Project Manager]

   **Current prompt files:**

   * ``syspilot.pm.prompt.md`` — Project Manager
   * ``syspilot.cm.prompt.md`` — Change Manager
   * ``syspilot.qm.prompt.md`` — Quality Manager
   * ``syspilot.setup.prompt.md`` — Setup Manager
