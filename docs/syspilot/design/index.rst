Overview
--------

Design specifications define **how** the system should be implemented. They are:

* **Linked** - Connected to requirements via ``:links:``
* **Technical** - Implementation decisions and architecture
* **Traceable** - From requirements through to code

**Organization:** Level 2 is organized by **solution domain** — one file per
technical component or agent. This is intentionally different from Levels 0–1
which organize by problem domain.
