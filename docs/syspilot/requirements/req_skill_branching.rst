Skill: Branching Requirements
=============================

Requirements for the Git branching strategy.


.. req:: Development Integration Branch
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SKILL_BRANCHING_CHAINED
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, skill, branching, workflow
   :links: SYSP_US_SKILL_BRANCHING

   **Description:**
   syspilot SHALL use a permanent ``development`` integration branch. Feature
   branches are created from ``development`` and squash-merged back into
   ``development`` when complete. All work — specs, code, tests, docs — is
   committed on the feature branch before merging.

   **Rationale:**
   A permanent integration branch decouples in-progress work from releases.
   Feature branches integrate into ``development`` via squash-merge, keeping
   history clean and enabling independent review per change.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: New feature branches are created from ``development``
   * AC-2: All changes (RST specs, code, tests, documentation) are committed on feature branches
   * AC-3: Completed feature branches are squash-merged into ``development``
   * AC-4: ``development`` is always the integration target — not other feature branches


.. req:: Main Branch Protection
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SKILL_BRANCHING_MAIN_PROTECTION
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, skill, branching, workflow
   :links: SYSP_US_SKILL_BRANCHING

   **Description:**
   ONLY ``@syspilot.release`` SHALL commit to, merge to, or push to ``main``.
   No other agent may write to ``main`` under any circumstances.

   **Rationale:**
   Main always equals the latest release. Any non-release commit on main is a
   violation of the release process and could break the version history.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Only ``@syspilot.release`` may commit to ``main``
   * AC-2: Only ``@syspilot.release`` may merge to ``main`` (squash merge from ``development``)
   * AC-3: Only ``@syspilot.release`` may push to ``main``
   * AC-4: If an agent finds itself on ``main``, it SHALL create a feature branch before making changes
   * AC-5: ``development`` → ``main`` merges are squash-merges performed exclusively by ``@syspilot.release``


.. req:: Branch Naming Conventions
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SKILL_BRANCHING_NAMING
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, skill, branching, workflow
   :links: SYSP_US_SKILL_BRANCHING

   **Description:**
   Branches SHALL follow these naming conventions:

   * ``feature/<name>`` — for changes created by ``@syspilot.design``
   * ``update/v{version}`` — for updates created by ``@syspilot.setup``
   * ``development`` — permanent integration branch
   * ``main`` — releases only, managed by ``@syspilot.release``

   **Rationale:**
   Consistent branch naming makes it immediately clear what type of work a
   branch contains and which agent created it.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Change branches use the ``feature/<name>`` pattern
   * AC-2: Update branches use the ``update/v{version}`` pattern
   * AC-3: No other branch patterns are used
   * AC-4: Branch names use lowercase with hyphens (no underscores or spaces)
