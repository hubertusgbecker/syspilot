Setup Manager Requirements
===========================


.. req:: Setup Bootloader Soul
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_SOUL
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, soul, bootloader
   :links: SYSP_US_SETUP

   **Description:**
   The Setup Bootloader agent (syspilot.setup) SHALL have a Soul that defines it as
   minimal, reliable, and transparent. It is the stable entry point — user-invocable —
   that fetches and places manifest files, then delegates orchestration to the Installer.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Setup Bootloader Soul defines a minimal, reliable, transparent character
   * AC-2: Setup Bootloader is user-invocable


.. req:: Installer Duties
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_DUTIES
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, duties
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   The Installer SHALL guarantee the following outcomes through its Duties.
   The Installer's scope is defined by SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_SCOPE.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: After every successful run, all syspilot product components within
     the defined installation scope are complete and correctly placed in the
     target project
   * AC-2: No installation run ends in a half-installed or unvalidated state —
     the result always passes sphinx-build before being reported as successful
   * AC-3: Every successful installation leaves a traceable Git commit
   * AC-4: If a Skill belonging to an exclusive group is being installed and
     a Skill of the same group already exists, the existing Skill is removed
     before the new one is written — mutual exclusion is enforced through
     replacement, and the run summary names the replaced Skill
   * AC-5: The file sync for every directory in scope is idempotent — re-running
     with unchanged source produces the same end-state with no side effects
   * AC-6: A file is eligible for orphan removal only if its name starts with
     the ``syspilot.`` filename prefix **and** does not end with
     ``.tailoring.md``; an eligible file present in a target directory but no
     longer existing in the corresponding source directory is removed (orphan
     cleanup). Files without the ``syspilot.`` prefix, and ``syspilot.*``
     files ending in ``.tailoring.md``, are never removed
   * AC-7: The Installer run summary reports installed / updated / removed
     counts so the invoking agent can verify completeness
   * AC-8: All files written by the Installer are encoded as UTF-8 without BOM
   * AC-9: The Installer performs file operations directly per file — it
     SHALL NOT generate wrapper scripts or helper files
   * AC-10: On any failure between install start and final commit, the
     Installer restores the workspace to the pre-install state via
     transactional rollback


.. req:: Installer Workflow
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_WORKFLOW
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, workflow
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER; SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_WORKFLOW

   **Description:**
   The Installer agent SHALL follow a workflow from source fetch through
   installation to validation and commit. The installation scope is governed
   by SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_SCOPE. Doc bootstrapping is governed by
   SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_DOC_BOOTSTRAP. Source acquisition is governed by
   SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_GITHUB_SOURCE. Encoding is governed by
   SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_ENCODING. File operations discipline is governed by
   SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_DIRECT_OPS. Rollback is governed by
   SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_ROLLBACK. Orchestration variant selection is governed by
   SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_ORCHESTRATION_SELECT. Session scaffold creation is
   governed by SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_SESSION_SCAFFOLD.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Workflow starts with fetching from upstream GitHub repository
     (default branch ``main``); branch override only via explicit user prompt
     at runtime
   * AC-2: Installer checks dependencies (Python, Sphinx, sphinx-needs);
     if any dependency is missing, prints install instructions and stops —
     does NOT auto-install
   * AC-3: Before file operations, Installer creates a pre-install Git commit
     of the current ``.github/`` state as a rollback point
   * AC-4: Installer installs/updates files within the defined scope by
     fetching each file from upstream and writing it to the target location
   * AC-5: During install/update, for each file in scope, all frontmatter
     fields come from upstream — no local field is preserved; every file is
     written verbatim from upstream
   * AC-6: During Configure step, Installer performs doc bootstrap per
     SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_DOC_BOOTSTRAP
   * AC-7: During Configure step, Installer selects and installs exactly one
     orchestration-group Skill per SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_ORCHESTRATION_SELECT
   * AC-8: During Orphan Cleanup, Installer detects orphan files in each
     target directory (files that start with ``syspilot.`` and do not end
     with ``.tailoring.md``, present in target but absent in source) and
     removes them; files without the ``syspilot.`` prefix and
     ``syspilot.*.tailoring.md`` files are left untouched
   * AC-9: After Install/Update, Installer outputs a run summary with
     per-directory counts of installed, updated, and removed files
   * AC-10: Installer validates with sphinx-build; on failure, executes
     transactional rollback per SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_ROLLBACK
   * AC-11: When the asynchronous orchestration variant was selected, as the
     final step before commit, Installer creates session scaffolds per
     SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_SESSION_SCAFFOLD
   * AC-12: On success, Installer creates final Git commit documenting
     the installation


.. req:: Installer GitHub-Only Source
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_GITHUB_SOURCE
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, source
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   The Installer SHALL always fetch product files from the upstream GitHub
   repository. There is no local-source path, no source-choice dialog, and
   no mode-detection step. The Installer always installs the latest version
   from the specified branch.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Installer always fetches files from upstream GitHub — no local
     ``syspilot/`` directory is ever used as install source
   * AC-2: There is no source-choice dialog presented to the user
   * AC-3: There is no Mode-Detect step — the Installer always installs
     the latest upstream version without comparing against an installed version
   * AC-4: Default fetch branch is ``main``; branch override is only possible
     via explicit user prompt at runtime


.. req:: Installer File Encoding
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_ENCODING
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, encoding
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   The Installer SHALL write all output files using UTF-8 encoding without
   Byte Order Mark (BOM). This applies to every file written during
   installation, update, or configuration.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: All files written by the Installer are encoded as UTF-8
   * AC-2: No file written by the Installer contains a BOM (byte sequence
     ``EF BB BF``)
   * AC-3: The encoding rule applies regardless of platform (Windows,
     macOS, Linux)


.. req:: Installer Direct File Operations
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_DIRECT_OPS
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, file-ops
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   The Installer SHALL perform all file operations directly per file using
   platform-native commands (e.g. ``Invoke-WebRequest`` + ``Out-File`` on
   PowerShell, or equivalent). It SHALL NOT generate wrapper scripts, helper
   files, or intermediary artifacts.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Each file is fetched and written individually via direct platform
     commands
   * AC-2: The Installer never generates wrapper scripts (e.g.
     ``install.ps1``, ``install.sh``)
   * AC-3: The Installer never writes helper files to ``temp/`` or any other
     temporary location
   * AC-4: No intermediary artifacts are produced — only the final target
     files within the installation scope


.. req:: Installer Transactional Rollback
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_ROLLBACK
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, rollback, transaction
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   The Installer SHALL implement a git-based transactional model: a
   pre-install commit is created before file operations begin, and on any
   failure between install start and final commit, the workspace is restored
   to the pre-install state via ``git reset --hard``.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Before file operations begin, a pre-install Git commit is created
     capturing the current state of ``.github/``
   * AC-2: On any failure between the pre-install commit and the final
     success commit, the Installer executes ``git reset --hard`` to the
     pre-install commit SHA
   * AC-3: After rollback, the workspace is in exactly the state it was
     before the Installer started — no partial installation remains
   * AC-4: On successful completion, the pre-install commit is replaced by
     the final post-install commit


.. req:: Installer Installation Scope
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_SCOPE
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, scope
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   The Installer SHALL have a positively defined installation scope: only the
   following product subdirectories from ``syspilot/`` are copied to the target
   project. syspilot-internal sources SHALL never be copied to user projects.

   **Installation scope (copied to target project):**

   * ``syspilot/agents/`` → ``.github/agents/``
   * ``syspilot/prompts/`` → ``.github/prompts/``
   * ``syspilot/skills/`` → ``.github/skills/``
   * ``syspilot/templates/`` → ``.github/templates/``

   **Explicitly excluded (NOT copied to user projects):**

   * ``docs/syspilot/`` (syspilot-internal specification sources)
   * ``docs/changes/`` (syspilot change documents)
   * ``syspilot/sphinx/`` (syspilot build scripts for its own docs — not user product)
   * ``syspilot/bootstrap.json`` (Bootloader manifest — consumed by Bootloader, not Installer)
   * Any other file or directory not listed in the installation scope above

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Only directories listed in the installation scope are copied to the target project
   * AC-2: ``docs/syspilot/`` is never copied to any user project
   * AC-3: ``docs/changes/`` is never copied to any user project
   * AC-4: No unlisted file or directory from the syspilot source is copied to the target project
   * AC-5: The sync for each directory in scope is idempotent — re-running
     the Installer with unchanged source yields the identical end-state
   * AC-6: A file is eligible for orphan removal only if its name starts with
     the ``syspilot.`` filename prefix **and** does not end with
     ``.tailoring.md``; an eligible file present in a target directory but no
     longer existing in the corresponding source directory is removed (orphan
     cleanup). Files without the ``syspilot.`` prefix, and ``syspilot.*``
     files ending in ``.tailoring.md``, are never removed
   * AC-7: The Installer run summary reports the count of files installed,
     updated, and removed per scope directory


.. req:: Installer Doc Bootstrap
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_DOC_BOOTSTRAP
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, doc-bootstrap
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   During the Configure step, the Installer SHALL check whether the target
   project already has a ``docs/index.rst``. If not, it SHALL create a minimal
   starter file. If yes, the existing file SHALL NOT be modified.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: If target project has no ``docs/index.rst``, Installer creates a minimal starter ``index.rst`` with a brief "documentation base" statement
   * AC-2: If target project already has a ``docs/index.rst``, it is not overwritten or modified
   * AC-3: The created starter ``index.rst`` is valid RST and does not cause sphinx-build warnings


.. req:: Bootloader Duties
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_BOOTLOADER_DUTIES
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, bootloader, duties
   :links: SYSP_US_SETUP

   **Description:**
   The Setup Bootloader SHALL guarantee the following outcomes through its Duties.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: The user always has exactly one, stable entry point into syspilot —
     regardless of internal evolution
   * AC-2: Every invocation executes the upstream-current Installer logic —
     the locally installed version is never authoritative
   * AC-3: If the Bootloader detects version incompatibility with upstream,
     the user is protected from a faulty run (invocation is blocked with
     user-visible error)
   * AC-4: After every Bootloader run, exactly the files declared in
     bootstrap.json have been placed — no more, no less (Manifest Fidelity)


.. req:: Setup Manager Frontmatter Configuration
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_FRONTMATTER
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, frontmatter
   :links: SYSP_US_SETUP; SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_FRONTMATTER

   **Description:**
   The Setup Manager agent SHALL be configured with YAML Agent Frontmatter that
   declares it as a user-invocable manager with editing and execution capabilities.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Setup Manager frontmatter declares ``user-invocable: true``
   * AC-2: Setup Manager frontmatter lists ``agents: ["syspilot.installer"]``
   * AC-3: Setup Manager frontmatter includes ``read``, ``edit``, ``search``, ``execute``, ``todo``, ``agent/runSubagent``, ``vscode/askQuestions`` in tools
   * AC-4: The setup agent frontmatter SHALL include a ``version:`` field reflecting the installed syspilot version


.. req:: Setup Manager Prompt File
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_PROMPT
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, prompt
   :links: SYSP_US_SETUP; SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_PROMPT

   **Description:**
   The Setup Manager SHALL have a prompt file ``syspilot.setup.prompt.md`` that
   enables direct user invocation via VS Code Copilot.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: File ``syspilot.setup.prompt.md`` exists in the prompts directory


.. req:: Bootloader Fetch and Place Manifest Files
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_BOOTLOADER_FETCH
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, bootloader
   :links: SYSP_US_SETUP

   **Description:**
   The Setup Bootloader SHALL fetch and place the files declared in the upstream
   bootstrap manifest (GitHub raw URL, ``main`` branch) on every run before
   invoking the Installer.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Bootloader reads ``syspilot/bootstrap.json`` from upstream to resolve file list
   * AC-2: Bootloader fetches each file listed in the manifest ``files[]`` array and writes it to the specified destination
   * AC-3: Fetch happens on every Bootloader run (no local caching)


.. req:: Bootloader Invoke Installer
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_BOOTLOADER_INVOKE
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, bootloader
   :links: SYSP_US_SETUP

   **Description:**
   The Setup Bootloader SHALL call the fetched Installer as a synchronous
   in-process subagent, passing through the user's original request context.
   This call is a deliberate exception **outside the orchestration contract**:
   it does not use the orchestration skill and does not use the SEND/RECEIVE/
   RESPOND verbs, because the Bootloader runs before any orchestration skill or
   session infrastructure is available.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Bootloader calls the Installer as a synchronous in-process subagent
   * AC-2: Bootloader passes user context to the Installer
   * AC-3: The Bootloader → Installer call is explicitly outside the orchestration contract — it does not use the orchestration skill or its verbs


.. req:: Bootloader Version Gate
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_BOOTLOADER_VERSION
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, bootloader
   :links: SYSP_US_SETUP

   **Description:**
   The Setup Bootloader SHALL validate the ``bootstrap_version`` field in the
   upstream manifest. If the manifest version exceeds the Bootloader's supported
   version, the Bootloader SHALL stop with a user-visible error message.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Bootloader extracts ``bootstrap_version`` from the manifest already fetched by the Bootloader Fetch step — no additional upstream read
   * AC-2: If ``bootstrap_version`` > supported version, Bootloader displays a user-visible error and stops
   * AC-3: Error message instructs user to update their Bootloader


.. req:: Installer Not User-Invocable
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_INSTALLER_NOT_USER_INVOCABLE
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, installer
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   The Installer agent SHALL NOT be directly user-invocable. It is an internal
   subagent invoked exclusively by the Bootloader.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Installer frontmatter declares ``user-invocable: false``
   * AC-2: Installer agent documentation states it is invoked by Bootloader only


.. req:: Setup Agent Skill Mutual Exclusion
   :id: SYSP_REQ_SETUP_SKILL_MUTEX
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, setup, skill, mutex
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   The Setup Agent SHALL enforce mutual exclusion for Skills that declare a
   ``group:`` field: at most one Skill per group is installed at any time. When
   a Skill of a group is installed and a Skill of the same group already exists,
   the Setup Agent SHALL remove the existing Skill before writing the new one,
   and SHALL report the replacement to the user.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Before installing a Skill with a ``group:`` field, Setup Agent checks whether any installed Skill declares the same ``group:`` value
   * AC-2: If a Skill of the same group is found, Setup Agent removes the existing Skill before writing the new one — installation proceeds through replacement, not rejection
   * AC-3: After installation, exactly one Skill of the group is present and the run summary names the replaced Skill (if any)


.. req:: Installer Orchestration Variant Selection
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_ORCHESTRATION_SELECT
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, orchestration, skill
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER, SYSP_US_SKILL_ORCHESTRATION

   **Description:**
   The Installer SHALL install exactly one orchestration-group Skill, chosen
   between the asynchronous (session-messaging) variant and the synchronous
   (in-process) variant. The Installer SHALL ask the user which variant to use
   and SHALL infer the default answer from the workspace: if a session-messaging
   infrastructure is detected, the asynchronous variant is the default;
   otherwise the synchronous variant is the default. The selected variant is
   installed under the mutual-exclusion rule (SYSP_REQ_SETUP_SKILL_MUTEX).

   **Rationale:**
   syspilot must run with or without session-messaging infrastructure. Letting
   the Installer pick a sensible default while still asking keeps installation
   automatic in the common case and explicit when the user wants the other
   variant.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Given an install or update, When the Installer runs, Then it asks the user which orchestration variant to install
   * AC-2: Given a workspace with session-messaging infrastructure present, When the Installer determines the default, Then the asynchronous variant is the default
   * AC-3: Given a workspace without session-messaging infrastructure, When the Installer determines the default, Then the synchronous variant is the default
   * AC-4: Given the variant is chosen, When the Installer writes it, Then exactly one orchestration-group Skill is present afterward (mutual exclusion via replacement)


.. req:: Installer Actor Creation
   :id: SYSP_REQ_INSTALLER_SESSION_SCAFFOLD
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, installer, session, scaffold
   :links: SYSP_US_INSTALLER

   **Description:**
   When the asynchronous orchestration variant is selected, the Installer SHALL,
   as the final installation step, create a Jarvis actor for every installed
   agent except the Setup Bootloader and the Installer. Each actor declares
   the agent's identity, derived from the agent file's frontmatter. The
   Installer SHALL use a three-way idempotency check: skip if an actor already
   exists, skip with a warning if a legacy session scaffold exists, and create
   only when neither exists. Existing actors and their agent-owned context
   SHALL be preserved on update.

   **Rationale:**
   The asynchronous variant runs each orchestrating agent as its own persistent
   session. Pre-declaring an actor per agent gives every agent a stable session
   identity and a place to accumulate its own context across changes, without the
   Installer ever overwriting accumulated context. The three-way check handles
   both fresh installs and workspaces migrating from the legacy session format.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: Given the asynchronous variant is selected, When the Installer finishes, Then an actor exists for every installed agent except the Setup Bootloader and the Installer
   * AC-2: Given an agent file with identity frontmatter, When the Installer creates that agent's actor, Then the actor's identity is taken from the agent file's frontmatter
   * AC-3: Given an update where an actor already exists, When the Installer runs, Then the existing actor and its agent-owned context are left untouched
   * AC-4: Given an update where a legacy session scaffold exists, When the Installer runs, Then the actor is not created and a warning is emitted
   * AC-5: Given neither actor nor legacy session exists, When the Installer runs, Then jarvis_createActor is called
   * AC-6: Given the synchronous variant is selected, When the Installer finishes, Then no actors are created
