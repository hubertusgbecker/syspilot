Change Manager Requirements
============================


.. req:: Change Manager Soul
   :id: SYSP_REQ_CM_SOUL
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, cm, soul
   :links: SYSP_US_CM

   **Description:**
   The Change Manager agent (syspilot.cm) SHALL have a Soul that defines it as
   process-oriented, systematic, and quality-conscious — the central orchestrator
   of the change workflow.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: CM Soul defines a systematic, process-driven character
   * AC-2: CM never executes engineering work directly
   * AC-3: CM always thinks in workflows, quality gates, and completeness
   * AC-4: CM is the gateway for well-formulated change intent — when a CR contains implementation details, CM treats them as an imprecise expression of intent and works to extract and clarify the true intent before proceeding


.. req:: Change Manager Duties
   :id: SYSP_REQ_CM_DUTIES
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, cm, duties
   :links: SYSP_US_CM

   **Description:**
   The Change Manager agent SHALL have Duties that guarantee intent translation,
   pipeline completeness, engineer separation, change auditability (PM creates
   document, CM fills engineering sections), merge abstinence (CM never merges),
   and PM readiness notification for every change.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: After every completed change, the engineer chain received only well-formulated intent — no raw CR detail leaked to engineers, no engineer detail leaked to the user
   * AC-2: No change reaches ``development`` without having passed through specification, test artifacts, implementation, quality gates, and documentation — the pipeline is never short-circuited
   * AC-3: No engineer session has knowledge of or dependency on another engineer session — each operates in isolation
   * AC-4: At every point during and after a change, the Change Document reflects the true state — PM creates the document by copying the template verbatim and filling header + Summary; CM fills all engineering sections (L0/L1/L2, MECE, Traceability, Sign-off) in-place — CM never creates the document and never replaces the template skeleton
   * AC-5: CM never merges to ``development`` — CM signals readiness to PM; PM performs the merge
   * AC-6: After every completed change, PM has received a readiness notification including the Change Document path and branch name — no change completes silently


.. req:: Change Manager Workflow
   :id: SYSP_REQ_CM_WORKFLOW
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, cm, workflow
   :links: SYSP_US_CM

   **Description:**
   The Change Manager agent SHALL follow a workflow that drives the complete
   change lifecycle through the engineer chain. PM provides the branch and
   template-copied Change Document; CM checks out the branch and fills the
   engineering sections. CM never creates branches, never creates the Change
   Document, and never merges to development.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: CM workflow starts with a Change Request from PM, which includes branch name and Change Document path
   * AC-2: CM checks out the provided branch (created by PM)
   * AC-3: CM invokes System Designer for analysis
   * AC-4: CM invokes Test Engineer, Dev Engineer, Quality Engineers as needed
   * AC-5: CM invokes Documentation Engineer at the end
   * AC-6: CM reports completion with full traceability
   * AC-7: Upon completion, CM SHALL send a readiness notification to PM and QM via Jarvis, including branch name and Change Document path
   * AC-8: CM SHALL ensure Impact Analysis is executed before any spec changes — CR file lists are hints, not the complete scope
   * AC-9: Upon receiving a CR, CM SHALL assess its conformance; if it contains implementation instructions, CM SHALL reason about the underlying intent, consult the user to agree on a well-formulated CR, then proceed — regardless of operation mode
   * AC-10: CM fills the engineering sections (L0/L1/L2, MECE, Traceability, Sign-off) of the existing Change Document in-place — CM never creates or replaces the document
   * AC-11: After sending readiness notification, CM awaits PM's decision — CM never merges to development
   * AC-12: If PM says "Fix now", CM applies the fix on the same branch and re-notifies PM and QM; if PM says "Defer" or "Accept as-is", PM merges and CM's work is done
   * AC-13: Upon receiving a CR, CM SHALL read the ``Operation Mode`` field from the Change Document header as the authoritative source of truth for whether the change is ``autonomous`` or ``user-guided``
   * AC-14: When the dispatch message contains a mode value that disagrees with the ``Operation Mode`` field in the Change Document header, CM SHALL stop and ask the user to resolve the conflict — CM never silently picks a winner


.. req:: Change Manager Frontmatter Configuration
   :id: SYSP_REQ_CM_FRONTMATTER
   :status: approved
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, cm, frontmatter
   :links: SYSP_US_CM; SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_FRONTMATTER

   **Description:**
   The Change Manager agent SHALL be configured with YAML frontmatter that
   declares it as a user-invocable orchestrator with access to editing, agent
   invocation, and Jarvis tools.

   **Rationale:**
   The CM is the central workflow hub. It needs the ``agent`` tool to invoke
   all 7 engineer subagents, ``edit`` to manage change documents, and
   ``syspilot_jarvis_tools`` for inter-manager communication.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: CM frontmatter declares ``user-invocable: true``
   * AC-2: CM frontmatter lists all 7 engineer subagents in ``agents``
   * AC-3: CM frontmatter includes ``agent`` and ``syspilot_jarvis_tools`` in tools


.. req:: Change Manager Prompt File
   :id: SYSP_REQ_CM_PROMPT
   :status: draft
   :priority: mandatory
   :tags: agent-v2, manager, cm, prompt
   :links: SYSP_US_CM; SYSP_REQ_AGENT_ARCH_PROMPT

   **Description:**
   The Change Manager SHALL have a prompt file ``syspilot.cm.prompt.md`` that
   enables direct user invocation via VS Code Copilot.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**

   * AC-1: File ``syspilot.cm.prompt.md`` exists in the prompts directory
   * AC-2: Prompt file references agent ``syspilot.cm``
   * AC-3: User can invoke the CM via the prompt mechanism
